# Autonomy and Scaling Strategy

## Agent Hiring Triggers
- Based on backlog size, project deadlines, or evaluation feedback.
- Evaluated periodically by the orchestratorâ€™s metrics module.

## Evaluation Mechanisms
- Each new agent enters a probation flow.
- Success metrics (score > threshold) trigger registration.

## Scaling Policy
- Horizontal scaling through K8s replicas.
- Crew-level scaling (replicating whole departments) allowed for large workloads.

## Model Evolution
- Agents retrain or update using fine-tuned models per domain.
- Older versions archived but auditable.

## Distributed Operation
- Use message queues or vector stores for inter-agent coordination.
