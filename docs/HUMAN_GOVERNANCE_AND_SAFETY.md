# Human Governance and Safety

## Human Oversight
- Humans act as auditors and approvers for production-level actions.
- Any external API call or deployment must require human signature in initial phase.

## Security Model
- Namespaces for isolation.
- Secrets managed via Vault or sealed-secrets.
- Zero-trust networking between agents.

## Ethical Boundaries
- No unsupervised code deployment to live environments.
- No data exfiltration or unauthorized learning from sensitive data.

## Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs.
- Metrics (CPU, memory, success rate) tracked per agent.

## Governance Workflow
- Human supervisor can pause or terminate agents via API.
- All hiring and firing decisions logged immutably.
