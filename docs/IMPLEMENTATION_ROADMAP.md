# Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: MVP (Core Orchestrator)
- Implement FastAPI orchestrator with CrewAI integration.
- Add hiring API (mocked Kubernetes client).
- Introduce registry and probation flow.

## Phase 2: LangGraph Integration
- Define product_dev_flow and hire_flow as LangGraph workflows.
- Connect orchestrator triggers to LangGraph supervisor API.
- Simulate autonomous hiring based on project needs.

## Phase 3: Kubernetes Integration
- Replace mock pods with real K8s API calls.
- Namespace-based agent isolation.
- Add health checks, logs, and dynamic resource allocation.

## Phase 4: Persistent Knowledge Base
- Integrate Weaviate or other vector DB.
- Allow cross-agent context retrieval and task chaining.

## Phase 5: Autonomous Scaling
- Implement feedback-based scaling decisions.
- Enable self-hiring and auto-termination of idle agents.

## Key Risks
- Agent loops or runaway behavior.
- Resource leaks or unbounded scaling.
- Governance compliance drift.
